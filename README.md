# digital-image-processing
 This repository contains code for various tranformations needed in image processing.
 
 Entire code is written in matlab without using image processing toolkit functions.
 
 It is done by the following 3 people -
 1. Mudit Garg
 2. Niranjan Thirusaga
 3. Mayank Murali


**Details of Project 1:**
The task of project 1 is to find the smallest disk and largest disk in the RandomDisks Image using mathematical morphology operations.
* Firstly, salt & pepper noise is removed from the image using close and open operation.
* A disk shaped structuring element is selected and hit-or-miss transform is performed.
* Another structuring element is window with a hole in between.
* In the end, we are able to find the smallest disks and largest disks only, using different sized structuring elements.
